# Interrobang.js

Have you heard‽ Interrobang.js parses your content for combined instances of
both question and exclamation (e.g., ?!, !?, ???!!!, etc.), and replaces
them with interrobangs (‽).

## Usage

Include `interrobang.js` and call `punctuationEmbetterment`, passing the target
element you want to parse. See `example.html` for a full example.

## What?

Check it. [Get learned](http://www.shadycharacters.co.uk/2011/04/the-interrobang-part-1/) on the interrobang and why it is so awesome (just like narwhals).
